Generate a comprehensive executive technical debt report for the repository at: {{args}}

This command will automatically:
1. Scan the codebase for technical debt and code quality issues
2. Run AI code detection to identify AI-generated code patterns
3. Audit dependencies for security vulnerabilities
4. Generate a professional executive PDF report

Execute these tools in order:
1. scan_repo with { "repoPath": "{{args}}" }
2. dep_audit with { "repoPath": "{{args}}" }
3. generate_report with { "scanResults": "<scan_json>", "auditResults": "<audit_json>", "repoPath": "{{args}}", "projectName": "<project_name>" }

The comprehensive report will include:
📊 Technical Debt Analysis (SQALE, DORA metrics, complexity)
🤖 AI Code Detection (patterns, confidence, risk assessment)
🔒 Security Audit (vulnerabilities, outdated packages)
💡 Strategic Recommendations (prioritized action items)

Output files saved in repository:
- Markdown: techdebt-cto-report-YYYY-MM-DD.md (detailed technical report)
- PDF: techdebt-cto-report-YYYY-MM-DD.pdf (executive-ready presentation)

The PDF features professional styling with:
- Color-coded health score badge
- Visual progress bars and charts
- Severity-based vulnerability badges
- Board-ready layout for C-level executives

Provide an executive summary of the key findings after generation.
