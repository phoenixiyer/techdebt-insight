## Tech Debt Insight

Enterprise-grade technical debt analysis for any codebase, delivered as a **Gemini CLI extension**.
Think of this as a **baseline, extensible framework** to *discover, visualize, and reason about* tech debt. It ships sensible defaults, but **every rule/threshold/weight is configurable**.

> **Not prescriptive.** Different orgs define tech debt differently. Use this as a **starting point**; fork/tune to your standards.


## ✨ What it does (quick)

* Scans code for hotspots (long files, complexity, duplication, missing tests), dependency drift, security smells.
* Generates **CTO-ready reports** (Markdown + optional PDF) with prioritized actions, effort/impact, and a 2–4 week plan.
* Includes **AI Code Detection** to flag likely AI-generated patterns (heuristic, configurable).
* Works locally or in CI, across monorepos/services.

## 🔧 Installation

### Option A — Install from GitHub (recommended for users)

```bash
gemini extensions install https://github.com/phoenixiyer/techdebt-insight
```

### Option B — Local dev (for contributors)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/phoenixiyer/techdebt-insight.git
cd techdebt-insight
npm install
npm run build
gemini extensions link .
```

Now restart `gemini` and run `/mcp` — you should see the Node server connected. (Your repo already documents this flow.) ([GitHub][1])

---

## 🚀 Usage

Common commands:

```bash
# Full analysis (tech debt + AI detection) on current dir
gemini techdebt:scan .

# Dedicated AI code detection only
/techdebt:ai-scan .

# Dependency audit only
/techdebt:audit .

# Executive CTO report (Markdown + optional PDF)
/techdebt:report .
```

> Tip: You can also pass an absolute path instead of `.`


## ⚙️ Configuration (start here to de-opinionate)

Create a `.techdebt.json` in your repo root:

```json
{
  "ignorePatterns": ["**/node_modules/**", "**/dist/**", "**/*.generated.*"],
  "rules": {
    "maxFileLines": 600,
    "complexityTokens": ["if","for","while","case","catch","&&","||"],
    "dupLongLineLen": 120,
    "dupRatioThreshold": 2.0,
    "requireTests": true
  },
  "weights": {
    "impact": { "security": 4, "availability": 3, "velocity": 2, "quality": 1 },
    "effortPenaltyLarge": 1
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "auditNode": true,
    "auditPython": true,
    "ignore": ["devDependencies"]
  },
  "aiDetection": {
    "enabled": true,
    "riskThreshold": 0.6,
    "signals": ["boilerplate","generic-names","edge-case-gaps","style-uniformity","tool-signature"]
  },
  "report": {
    "pdf": true,
    "ctoReport": true
  }
}
```

Everything above is **overrideable**: thresholds, weights, signals, and even which audits to run. (You already reference this format later in the README; moving it earlier puts the “not opinionated” story front-and-center.) ([GitHub][1])


## 🧭 Positioning (useful when someone says “opinionated”)

> **Baseline, not verdict.**
> This extension provides **neutral primitives** (long files, complexity, duplication, test gaps, dependency drift) and a **pluggable scoring** layer.
>
> * Swap thresholds/weights to match your standards
> * Add your own detectors (ESLint, SonarQube, radon, gocyclo, etc.)
> * Replace the prioritization function if needed
> * Turn AI detection on/off or change signals

This is a **framework for visibility** that AI can reason over — not a maturity scorecard.


## 📊 Outputs

* `techdebt-report-YYYY-MM-DD.md` — developer-level findings
* `ai-code-analysis-YYYY-MM-DD.md` — AI detection details
* `techdebt-cto-report-YYYY-MM-DD.md` — exec summary with Top-10 actions
* `techdebt-cto-report-YYYY-MM-DD.pdf` — optional PDF (if enabled)


## 🧪 CI example (GitHub Actions)

Use the *install-from-GitHub* pattern (works well in CI):

```yaml
name: Tech Debt Analysis
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  analyze:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
      - run: gemini extensions install https://github.com/phoenixiyer/techdebt-insight
      - run: gemini techdebt:scan . --fail-on=high
```

That “install from URL” pattern is what the directory shows for Stripe/GitHub/Grafana extensions. ([Gemini CLI][2])

## 🔒 Privacy & Safety

* No code leaves your machine unless your Gemini model/provider is remote.
* External tools (`npm outdated`, `pip-audit`) are executed locally; failures degrade gracefully to warnings.
* You control which paths are scanned via `ignorePatterns`.
* AI detection is **heuristic** and **not a compliance mechanism** — use it as a conversation starter, not a gate.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations / Known trade-offs

* Complexity proxy is a **cheap heuristic** (token counts) — swap in Sonar, ESLint, radon, or gocyclo if you need formal metrics.
* AI detection flags **patterns**, not provenance. Treat results as **indicators**, not proof.
* Dependency audit requires local tools (`npm`, `pip-audit`). When missing, reports include `warnings[]` and continue.

---

## 🧩 Extending

* Add detectors by calling them in the MCP tool and merging their JSON into the scoring step.
* Replace prioritization by editing the weights function.
* Create your own report templates (Markdown or PDF) - the command layer is just prompts.

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

* If `/mcp` shows **disconnected**: ensure `dist/example.js` exists and `gemini-extension.json` points to it; avoid `console.log` (stdout).
* Node ≥ 18.17 (prefer 20).
* Re-link after build: `gemini extensions link .`
* For debug logs, use `stderr`.
